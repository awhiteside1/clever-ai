# Thesis

The quality of an idea can drastically affect an outcome given the same effort spent by the same people with the same
resources. This is true at home and at work, whether you write novels or coordinate budgets.

Good ideas are more about the number of attempts and the variety of attempts, provided

- you have a way to judge “good”
- you have background knowledge /approaches to merge

Iterating on many attempts and variety is hard and time consuming

- Not worth it for many things, like a gif for a ppt
- Humans get ‘writers block’ or may not feel creative
- It’s a skill that improves with practice

LLMs make it cheap to create viable ideas at scale

- Extract context from many sources
- Combine with inspiration / good examples
- Create complete, judge-able ideas that can be evaluated by humans
  - Tinder swiping
  - Deep dive

Many tools / ecosystems exist that enable convenient use of such idea generation

- many outputs modalities now available and ever growing
