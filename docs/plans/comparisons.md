## Direct LLMs (ChatCPT, Claude, Gemini)

Chatbots that provide direct LLM access are general purpose and intentionally bare-bones. While possible to use them for
idea generation, you would need to do many time consuming and repetitive tasks: file uploading, thread organization and
isolation, prompt copy/paste, etc.

While LLMs appear very capable, it's important to remember that they work by predicting the next token (word) over and
over again until they predict a terminator. They do not have any understanding of what they emit and cannot perform
actual reasoning or logic.

## ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a general purpose chatbot that provides a very un-opinionated, bare bones access to the models in scoped
chat threads. It has limited integrations available for consumers.
