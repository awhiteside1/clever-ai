# How it Works

Given

1. a problem or set of constraints
2. context of the problem

If we could

1. generate ideas to solve that problem, varying on methodology used, influences, etc
2. evaluate each idea quantitatively for feasibility, alignment, impact, etc

Then we could

1. Create a library of mental models, problem solving approaches, methodologies, etc
2. Generate a bunch of ideas using randomly selected approaches.
3. Evaluate those ideas and bucket them into Good, neutral, and Bad
4. Bias future generation parameters towards the choices that netted in ‘good’ ideas, and away from those which were not
   deemed ‘good’
5. Repeat until statistics says we should stop, giving us possible global maximums
6. Take the top ideas and create variations from each, evaluating them and taking the top ideas

Resulting in the best ideas humanity would probably come up with for this situation

### Generating an Idea

1. Prompt an LLM:

> “Given **Context**, Apply **Methodology X** to **Problem** to form an **Idea** that will result in **Desired Outcomes
> **. Always follow **Rules**, Consider **Priorities**. Show your work step by step, then output the result as JSON.”

2. Cajole the output into valid format.

You now have an idea that is statistically probable to occur.

### Evaluating an Idea

## Features

### Private

Never store your data. Share files, folders and codebases with a dedicated email per project or via desktop agent. Remove access the same way.

_we store embeddings and knowledge graph entities that link to source documents, which we retrieve only when you request ideas, fully audited_

### Organized

Projects & Threads allow for intuitive organization of ideas, rules, goals, and resources. Automatic templates and assisted custom rules let you hit the ground running.

### Thoughtfully Considered

Ideas are evaluated on project tuned criteria, such as feasibility, alignment, and suitability, and get better with your feedback.

### Think like the best

Hundreds of methods, applied to your particular need. Constantly growing.

- Mental Models
- Business leaders
- Industry Knowledge
