# What If

What if you had a _clever_ **brainstorming** partner that

- **amplifies your thinking**, whatever you’re thinking about
- **learns from your feedback**, without significant hand holding
- **has context and knowledge**, without you spelling it out
- **thinks everything through**, without you having to think
- **is always there**, without getting in the way

## Uses

**Stuck on a detail?**
A range of possible options to use/explore/reject is just a click away.

**Know something could be better, but not sure how?**
Start a brainstorming sesh and iterate on problem and solution together. Let your assistant steer using best practices,
industry standards and its ideas, taking your direction as it goes. Take over when you have a stroke of genius, your
assistant will help you flush it out.

**Good idea out of the blue?**
Jot it down quickly, then get reminded of it next time you’re working on the relevant project.

**Stuck between two options?**
Compare them apples-to-apples, identify details you may have missed, and quantify the tradeoffs before you decide.
