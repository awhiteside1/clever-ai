## Key Concepts

These concepts form the primary domain for Clever AI, and form a simple system that helps users solve problems with
ideas.

### Users

Users represent individuals who interact with the system, create projects, link resources, and are the recipient of
ideas.

Users have many projects, inspirations, and integrations which are not accessible to other users.

### Projects

Projects represent a logical boundary of related information, resources, problems and ideas that are related and affect
each other.

Projects contain priorities, rules, linked resources, derived knowledge graph, ideas, identified problems, and
discussion sessions.

### Ideas

Ideas are actionable, feasible, solutions to a problem within a project, for a user. Ideas may be created by users or
generated by the system. Ideas are evaluated in the context of the project and users may give feedback on them.

Ideas reference the Problems they solve and the details, methods, and origin of how they were created.

### Problems

Problems are concrete, well defined, and scoped within the context of a Project. Problems are made up of a normalized
intent, such as "recurring negative situation between employees", or "writers block for a fictional story", as well as
details specific to the particular problem.

A Problem may resolve or change as new facts and messages are received, reference related problems and be used to
generate ideas.

### Rules & Priorities

Each project may have specific rules which must always be followed, as well as priorities which describe abstract values
to align with as much as possible during idea generation and evaluation.

Rules and priorites may be created by templates, by analysis or explicitly by Users and apply to all evaluations,
generations, and calculations within a particular project. Users may view and modify any rules or priorities.

### Knowledge

Knowledge refers to specifics known about a project based on user provided resources, discussions and feedback from the
user, and relevant external trusted sources.

Knowledge is specific to a project, may be updated by users and system components, and can be traversed like a graph.

### Resources

Resources are files, links, and documents which a user shares with a project. Resources are analyzed and the results
update the knowledge graph for a project. Resources reference external systems like Google Drive, Websites, and Dropbox,
and update when they are changed.

### Methodologies

Methodologies are holistic approaches to solving problems that are defined by experts and backed by empirical data. They
may vary in the types of problems they are relavent for, specificity in steps, and required information. Examples
include "Design Double Diamond", "First Principals Thinking", "Second Order Effects", and "Design by wishful thinking".

We will maintain a system catalog of the best methodologies that cover a variety of problems, which will be used to
generate ideas.

### Discussions

Discussions are chat threads about a particular problem, idea, or need the user has within the context of a project.
Discussions are freeform chat format, are independent form other discussions unless the user references a prior chat,
and provide an interactive brainstorming/idea session to help the user.
